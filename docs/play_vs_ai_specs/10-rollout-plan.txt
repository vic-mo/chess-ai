PLAY VS AI — ROLLOUT PLAN
=========================

PHASE A — Core Play (No Clocks)
-------------------------------
- Implement /game, /move, /stream; no time control
- Verify end-to-end: human vs engine with stable moves & results

PHASE B — Clocks & TC
---------------------
- Add time controls, increments, timeouts; integrate time manager mapping
- Add reconnect snapshot; polish WS throttling

PHASE C — UX Polish
-------------------
- Premove, draw/resign, PGN export, eval toggle polish, accessibility
- Error UX & toasts; mobile layout optimization

PHASE D — Scale & Hardening
---------------------------
- Load test, leaks, CPU budgets, rate limiting
- Dockerization, health checks, metrics dashboards
- Optional persistence (store game history)

DOD
---
- Each phase ships independently with feature flags
- Metrics confirm stability and user-perceived latency targets
