- Engine replies within time budget; optional ponder
- Eval panel toggle works; PGN export available

RESILIENCE
----------
- Reconnect restores state; desyncs resolved via server snapshot
- Resource caps enforced; idle games expire cleanly

QUALITY
-------
- CI: unit + integration + E2E green
- Load: 100 concurrent games for 60s; no leaks; stable latency
- Accessibility: keyboard nav and ARIA labels for board controls

DELIVERABLES
------------
- TXT specs (this set) added to docs/
