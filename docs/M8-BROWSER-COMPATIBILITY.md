2. **Web Workers** - For running engine in background thread
3. **ES2020** - For modern JavaScript features
4. **Dynamic Imports** - For loading WASM module

**Optional Features:**

- **SharedArrayBuffer** - For multi-threaded search (future)
- **Performance Memory API** - For memory usage tracking

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: iOS Safari JIT Limitations

**Problem:** WebAssembly JIT compilation is limited on iOS, resulting in ~40% performance reduction.

**Impact:** Analysis takes longer on iPhone/iPad

**Workaround:**

- Use lower depth settings (6 instead of 10)
- Use fake mode for UI testing
- Consider remote mode for serious analysis

**Status:** Platform limitation, no fix available

---

### Issue 2: Performance Memory API Not Available

**Problem:** Firefox and Safari don't expose `performance.memory`

**Impact:** Memory usage tracking not available

**Workaround:**

- Feature is optional
- Compatibility check prevents errors
- Chrome DevTools can be used for manual memory profiling

**Status:** Expected behavior, not a bug

---

### Issue 3: SharedArrayBuffer Requires Headers

**Problem:** SharedArrayBuffer requires COOP/COEP headers

**Impact:** Multi-threaded search won't work without proper headers (future feature)

**Workaround:**

```nginx
# Add to server config
add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin";
add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp";
```

**Status:** Security requirement, proper deployment needed

---

### Issue 4: Background Tab Throttling

**Problem:** Browsers throttle background tabs to save resources

**Impact:** Search slows down when tab is inactive

**Workaround:**

- Keep tab active during analysis
- Use Desktop/PWA mode if available
- Consider using remote mode for background processing

**Status:** Expected browser behavior

---

### Issue 5: Brave Shields May Block Workers

**Problem:** Brave's privacy shields may block Web Workers

**Impact:** WASM mode fails to initialize

**Workaround:**

- Disable shields for localhost/your domain
- Click shield icon → Advanced Controls → Disable for this site

**Status:** Privacy feature, user configuration needed

---

### For Testing

**Recommended Order:**

1. Chrome (primary development)
2. Firefox (cross-engine validation)
3. Safari macOS (WebKit testing)
4. Safari iOS (mobile testing)
5. Edge (Chromium validation)

## Server Configuration

### Development Server (Vite)

No special configuration needed. Vite handles everything correctly.

### Production Deployment

**Recommended headers:**

```nginx
# Compression (WASM compresses well)
gzip on;
gzip_types application/wasm application/javascript;

# Caching (WASM files are immutable)
location /wasm/ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}

# CORS (if serving from CDN)
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";

# Future: SharedArrayBuffer support
add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin";
add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp";
```

## Compatibility Detection in Code

The app includes automatic browser detection:

```typescript
import { getCompatibilityInfo } from './utils/browserDetect';

const info = getCompatibilityInfo();

console.log('Browser:', info.browser.name, info.browser.version);
console.log('Features:', info.features);
console.log('Warnings:', info.warnings);
console.log('Errors:', info.errors);
```

Compatibility warnings are automatically shown in the UI when issues are detected.
